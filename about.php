                <p><strong>Education:-</strong> 
        Education is both the act of teaching knowledge to others and the act of receiving knowledge from someone else.
        Education also refers to the knowledge received through schooling or instruction and to the institution of teaching as a whole.
        Education has a few other senses as a noun. </p>

            gender equality, peace, and stability. Developing countries have made tremendous progress in getting children into the classroom and the majority of children worldwide are now in primary school. Nevertheless,
            some 260 million children are still out of primary and secondary school.
